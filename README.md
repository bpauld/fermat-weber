# fermat-weber

This is the code for the work I did on the Fermat Weber problem over the summer 2018.
I studied the problem with "weighted" Euclidean norm, in both the constrained and box-constrained case, and proposed a Newton-type method achieving local quadratic convergence.

I also studied the problem with l1 and l-infinity norm, implementing the projected subgradient method and BFGS and comparing them.
